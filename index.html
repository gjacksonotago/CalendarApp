        <h3>Group Strengths and Weaknesses:</h3>
            <p>We're addressing this as a group thing simply because we all
            have roughly the same level of experience across all of the 
            languages and elements listed in the assignment spec. That is to say
            none at all.</p>
            
            <p>George: I have a little more HTML experience than the other two
                just because I did some incredibly basic website building for a
                Unit Standard in year 13. My other strength would be in clear 
                communication and report writing - these skills being honed throughout
                my honours law degree.
                </p>
            <p>Ben: My HTML and CSS experience is limited to an online course I did,
             the introduction to html on codecademy. As for the other languages I have
             exactly no experience with them what so ever.
