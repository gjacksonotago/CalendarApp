        <h3>Group Strengths and Weaknesses:</h3>
            <p>We're addressing this as a group thing simply because we all
            have roughly the same level of experience across all of the 
            languages and elements listed in the assignment spec. That is to say
            none at all.</p>
            
            <p>George: I have a little more HTML experience than the other two
            just because I did some incredibly basic website building for a
            Unit Standard in year 13. My other strength would be in clear 
            communication and report writing - these skills being honed throughout
            my honours law degree.
            </p>
            <p>Ben: My HTML and CSS experience is limited to an online course I did,
             the introduction to html on codecademy. As for the other languages I have
             exactly no experience with them what so ever.
            </p>
            <p> Mohammed: My experience in HTML is low so I'm trying to understand it with the group. </p>
            
        <h3>Our App Idea:</h3>
        <p>We're gonna build a Calendar application - one that works with an alarm for scheduling events.
        This'll allow for scheduling events into the calendar on a time, day, and with options for a description
        and an alarm. From there, it'll also have a couple of display options: a day display detailing just a single
        day in one go, with the option to move to the day on either side, and a week display that displays the week
        of days side-by-side.
