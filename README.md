# CalendarApp
Calendar Smart Watch App and just enough of an emulator to run it. For COSC345 at Otago Uni.
Assignment One is inside the Assignment One folder. 

Assignment 2:
The prototype and emulator for Assignment Two are Emulator folder, in public_html.
Notable functions: App launcher, home button and month changers are single click buttons. The calendar days are clickable via a double click so that they are not activated by the swipe. You can swipe left and right when calendar is displayed to change the
month. 'Swiping' being holding down the left mouse button and dragging it to one side then releasing.
