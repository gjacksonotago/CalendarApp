        <h2>Cosc 345 Assignment 1</h2>
        <h3>Group Name: BaReGiJoMuT</h3> <!--Temporary group name that is terrible lets change it-->
        <ul>Group Members: 
            <li>Ben Ryan - 3633356</li>
            <li>George Jackson - 1697309</li>

        </ul>
        
        <h3>Group Strengths and Weaknesses:</h3>
            <!--<p>We are addressing this as a group thing simply because we all
            have roughly the same level of experience across all of the 
            languages and elements listed in the assignment specification. That is to say, 
            almost none at all.</p> WE DON'T NEED THIS RIGHT? -->
            
            <p>George: I have a little more HTML experience than the other two
            just because I did some incredibly basic website building for a
            Unit Standard in year 13. My other strength would be in clear 
            communication and report writing - these skills being honed throughout
            my honours law degree.
            </p>
            <p>Ben: My HTML and CSS experience is limited to an online course I did,
             the introduction to html on codecademy. As for the other things I have
             exactly no experience with them what so ever. My coding skills are
             limited to that or first and second year computer science, not including
             the web paper. A weakness of mine is that I do not seem to work well
             with people looking over my shoulder as they might in a group situation. 
             I'm not sure I have any real strengths over the others as far as the assignment goes. 
             I suppose I have a general eye for detail which might help somewhere.
            </p>
            <p>Mohammed: My experience in HTML is low so I'm trying to understand it well 
            with the group. I'm good at organizing time and meetings, as I created a group on 
            facebook for easy communication between the group members.
            I also like to test the work.   
            </p>
            
        <h3>Our App Idea:</h3>
            <p>We are going to build a Calendar/Timetable application - one that works with an alarm for scheduling events.
            This will allow for scheduling events into the calendar on a time and day, with options for a description
            and an alarm. From there, it will have several display options: a day display detailing just a single
            day in one go— an hourly display may also be useful—with the option to move to the day on either side, 
            a week display that displays the week of days side-by-side, and of course a month display, to check 
            which days currently have scheduled events or to select a new day to enter times into. We intend
            for this to be an all purpose app for any kind of calendar related usage, be it your university timetable, 
            pill taking times, work schedule, one-off events etc.
            </p>

        <!-- My diagram is actually just two lists... will have to do, what else would I do? -Ben -->
        <h3>Work Partition "Diagram":</h3>
        <ul style="float:left">
            <h3>Emulator</h3>
            <li>Provide current Time and Date</li>
            <li>Physical alerts, noises etc.</li>
            <li>Touch screen (mouse click)</li>
            <li>Starting the app?</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="float:left">
            <h3>Application</h3>
            <li>Input data</li>
            <li>Alarms</li>
            <li>Interface for input</li>
        </ul>
        <div style="clear:both"></div>
        <h3>Our Version Control:</h3>
            <p>We are using github accounts and a github repository, found
            <a href="https://github.com/gjacksonotago/CalendarApp">here.</a> This was chosen by a previous
            group member. We stuck with it after having a quick look at sourceforge. This assured us that GitHub
            was easier for us to understand and use effectively, since we could not make sense of it.
            GitHub was fairly easy to work out.</p>
        
        <h3>Our Language Choice:</h3>
            <p>Given that what little experience across the three of us is mostly focussed in HTML, we will be
            looking to code the project in HTML, CSS and raw Javascript.
            We will be learning Javascript as we go, and likely consulting online guides for help with this. 
            George has the COMP112 textbook on HTML and CSS that he can use.
            </p>
            
        <h3>The Editor:</h3>
            <p>We have chosen to use Netbeans, for ease of use compared with the other IDE's suggested. 
            George is familiar with Netbeans, as he used it during first year to code in java at home, and 
            suggested we use that one because of that.
            Also, word of mouth has Eclipse being a horrible IDE to use for anything at all. 
            As for features, Netbeans has a Live Preview of Web Pages, support for various Javascript libraries
            such as jQuery and JSON, and editing support for CSS (also live preview), as well as a Javascript
            debugger for Chrome and the ability to comply with multiple broswers.
            </p>
            
        <h3>The Debugger:</h3>
            <p>As none of us know anything about debugging tools as separate tools from the IDE/Compiler, we are looking
            at using Firebug, because it works across Firefox and Safari, and NetBeans' own Chrome debugger to ensure 
            that we have a good range for debugging across the popular browsers.
            </p>
            
        <h3>Timetable for Assignment 2:</h3>
            <p>Week One: We will aim to understand what an emulator is and how to go about building one by the 18th/19th
                of April.</p>
            <p>Weeks Two and Three: We will aim to build the essential emulator functions - the data to push and pull and
                scripts to generate that kind of information and things and have just enough to build our prototype app.
                This work will be split across the three of us, as it is anticipated at the very least George will be quite
                busy over the entirety of the next assignment.
            </p>
            <p>Weeks four and five: Build basic prototype application and at least give it support to add and display custom events
                and have at least one type of display format - with support for at least 10 years in the future as an estimate
                until we can figure out how to generalize that.
            </p>
        <h4>Timetable for Assignment 3:</h4>
        <p> With a tentative hand in date, we do not think we can plan that far ahead, given that it will depend on
            just how much we complete with assignment 2, which is anybody's guess at this point.
