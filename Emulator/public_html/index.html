                Below should display the co-ordinates of where you
                last clicked on the big red canvas element you can see:

                Below is the canvas element. It currently displays the
                current time and date - which updates on mouseover or on 
                click of the canvas.
            </p>

        This displays the time on the canvas and updates the mouse 
        position onclick on the canvas area, and displays it up on the 
        divShow division. Updates time on mouseover on the canvas!
