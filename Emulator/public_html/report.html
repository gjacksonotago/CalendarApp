        <h3>Introduction:</h3>
        <p>The first thing to say is that our expectations of what the prototype was going to be were very optimistic.
            The reminder application has turned out not how we intended, but lives up to its name; it is a calendar
            application. Our estimates of how long each part would take were all well under what actually happened.
            We never got actual alerts going, so as it stands the prototype can store reminders for each day with a time
            and print that to the screen when the day is clicked on. It functions like a physical calendar where
            you can write a note for a given day but it is up to you to check each day. Also like a paper calendar
            you cannot remove a reminder once it is added–ignoring the existence of pencils–except by reloading the page and thus 
            resetting the whole thing. There is functionality to delete a reminder but it did not get implemented in the user 
            interface before we ran out of time.
        </p>
        <h3>User Interface:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>When the page is loaded you will see a 320x320 canvas displaying a nice wee frog picture with a black square that has
                    "Calendar App" written over it, as well as the time below. At this point the only thing you can do is click the button
                    and this will start the application.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Now you can see a month view of a calendar for the current month. Each day of the month
                    is clickable via a double click which will take you to a new page which contains the reminders for that day and the place
                    to enter new reminders. A single click (or just a mouse down action to be more specific) on a day will enlarge the square so you can 
                    see it better which you will notice happens when you double click just before the canvas reloads. When the squares are enlarged they
                    will automatically reset after 2 seconds from when the first one was clicked.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In the calendar month view you can change the month by either: single clicking the '<' and '>' buttons for going back and forwards
                    respectively, or 'swiping' by holding down the left mouse button and then moving left(back) or right(forward), then releasing.
                    Be careful with swiping, as a slight movement in a click may be registered as a swipe, which can cause you to enter a day different
                    to the one you intended (we did try to fix this but only caused much worse problems. To the best of our knowledge the days for each
                    month in any given year will be correct.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Once inside a certain day, on the first entry to that day there will be a text box and a button saying "Enter". Using
                    the keyboard you can enter text into the box after clicking on it. This text will be your reminder, once you press enter
                    it will be stored and printed out to the screen under the date. You can add up to 9 reminders on one day (limited by screen space).
                    Each reminder will automatically be associated with a time of 08:00 in 24 hour format if you do not specify one. You can specify the
                    time by adding it to the end of the reminder in the text box. It MUST be in this '00:00' or this '0:00' format and be at the end of the entered text.
                    Technically you do not have to use 24 hour time but using am and pm will not work. When reminders are printed to the screen they will have an
                    " - at: (time)" after the reminder.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>When you press the "back" button down in the left hand corner of the day view it will return to the month. Now there will be a red square in
                    the bottom right corner of the day indicating that there is a reminder stored for that day (if you entered one). When you go back
                    to the day with a reminder in it all the stored reminders will be printed to the screen. There will now also be a "New" button in the
                    bottom right corner, you click this if you wish to add another reminder to that day and it will take you to the original add reminder
                    screen as before.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In the month view you can do a downwards swipe, best to do it all the way from top to bottom of the canvas (minor bug issues). This will bring up a view of all the 
                    reminders saved for that month and the days they are on. If the reminders are more than can fit on the screen there will be a next 
                    button which will take you to a new screen with rest of the reminders, this will happen over and over until all reminders have been displayed. 
                    There is still a very much known bug with this where a reminder that has had more than nine reminders added will print the full message 
                    down the bottom of the screen under the buttons, but alas coding time is over.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
