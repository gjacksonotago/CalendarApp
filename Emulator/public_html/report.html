            <h3>Our Experiences</h3>
            <p>At this point in the process of building our emulator and prototype calendar, the majority of our time is spent 
            finding out how to do everything in the new languages. Not knowing them well means
            having to look up just about everything. This makes writing the code rather slow, sometimes agonisingly so.
            Hopefully as time goes on we will learn enough such that all we have to think about is how to write the
            code for each part and not have to google every function we need to use for it.
            </p>
            <p>We have been incrementally adding small bits to the calendar application, just to get it to do something.
            After each new addition we then think well, what does it need next? The focus so far has been on the functionality 
            and basic visualisation of the calendar and emulator home screen. At the moment we are just thinking about how to
            actually enter reminders into the dates.
            </p>
            <p>Using GitHub has been, interesting ... luckily most of the mistakes were made early on when it was not too much
            of a big deal. These were mistakes such as using only the master branch and then having multiple commits at the same
            time causing lost code. Although perhaps this could have been sorted out by merge conflicts but at the time we did not
            know how to use it. Branches as it turns out are very useful and important if you do not like losing hours of work, which
            in this case was not a huge amount of code. Now we know how to use it sufficiently, it is extremely useful.
            </p>
            <p>We have only a small amount of unit testing at the moment, but it has already turned out to be handy, as expected.
            So far one function has been shown to have very odd behaviour which would have been less easy to see without writing a
            simple test function for it. It is difficult though to add any more tests right now because most of our functions
            do not have simple testable return values; although there should be a way to do it, we have not found out how yet.
            </p>
