            <h3>Our Experiences:</h3>
            <p>At this point in the process of building our emulator and prototype calendar, the majority of our time is spent 
            finding out how to do everything in the new languages. Not knowing them well means
            having to look up just about everything. This makes writing the code rather slow, sometimes agonisingly so.
            Hopefully as time goes on we will learn enough such that all we have to think about is how to write the
            code for each part and not have to google every function we need to use for it.
            </p>
            <p>We have been incrementally adding small bits to the calendar application, just to get it to do something.
            After each new addition we then think well, what does it need next? The focus so far has been on the functionality 
            and basic visualisation of the calendar and emulator home screen. At the moment we are just thinking about how to
            actually enter reminders into the dates.
            </p>
            <p>Using GitHub has been, suffice to say, interesting. Luckily most of the mistakes were made early on when it wasn't too much
            of a big deal. These were mistakes such as using only the master branch and then having multiple commits at the same
            time causing lost code. Although perhaps this could have been sorted out by merge conflicts, but at the time we did not
            know how to use it. Branches as it turns out are very useful and important if you do not like losing hours of work, which
            in this case was not a huge amount of code as fortune has it. Now we know how to use it sufficiently, it is extremely useful.
            </p>
            <p>At the moment there is only a small amount of unit testing, but it has already turned out to be handy, as expected.
            So far one function has been shown to have very odd behaviour which would have been less easy to see without writing a
            simple test function for it. It is difficult though to add any more tests right now because most of our functions
            do not have simple testable return values; although there should be a way to do it, we have not found out how yet.
            Further to this is that most of the testing has involved single or multiple instances of console print statements to test
            very specific sections of the code, instead of running a unit test to test the function as a whole.
            </p>
            <p>Although most of the time is okay, Javascript's lack of typing is not desirable. To change now might be counterproductive (or maybe not)
            but looking back it would have been great to use a type-checked variant instead. We had to learn the hard way, but we learned.</p>
        
        <h3>Revised Estimates:</h3>
        <p>We'll aim for creation and display of reminders on the calendar and build up on top of that functionality. This has been designed so that
        if we run out of time, we at least have the ability to create the bare bones of a reminder to display and the rest is capable of being cut out.
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Basic reminder functionality (saving reminders, displaying on calendar for each day) by the end of June, ideally the 23rd. - George</li>
            <li>Alerts for set reminders by the 11th July. - Ben</li>
            <li>Events list, shows all events scheduled in calendar, chronologically ordered, also by the 11 July. - George</li>
            <li>Weekly view, by the 24th of July. - Ben</li>
            <li>Reminder repetitions, by the 24th July. - George</li>
            <li>Saving data between runs, by the 14th August. - George</li>
            <li>Search for dates, by the 14th of August. - Ben</li>
            <li>Make it pretty, we'll try to do this as we go along. But also Ben will work on it more if necessary/if time permits.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Stuff we could put in, but probably won't have time for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Touch scrolling.</li> 
            <li>Multi-touch registering.</li> 
            <li>Cloud integration.</li> 
            <li>A today button (though that might make it's way into the event list or the day view).</li> 
            <li>Ticking time.</li> 
            <li>Alarm tones.</li> 
            <li>Vibration emulation.</li> 
            <li>GPS based alerts.</li> 
            <li>GPS based time-zone detection.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Potential Design Changes:</h3>
        <p>Saving Data between runs of the emulator is going to have to be a feature worked on last because of the
        difficulty that we've encountered doing the simplest functions - such as simply displaying a calendar month and shifting
        between them. We're allocating more time to setting reminders by splitting functional parts into modules to be done at different
        times - like alerts will be dealt with separately to creation of reminders.
        </p>
        
        <p>We probably will have a larger focus on CSS and HTML - as at the moment everything is written in pure Javascript, and this might
        not be the best way to go about it. We currently have a little CSS functionality but we could certainly do with a lot more, and definitely do 
        more with HTML as well.
        </p>
        
        <p>We'll also focus on designing our prototype and emulator displays to operate and look more like an actual smartwatch, because so far we've
        only focused on functionality over aesthetics.
        </p>
        
        <p>Far more test cases, because we're finally at the stage where we have something substantial to test that doesn't just involve logging straight
        to the console.
