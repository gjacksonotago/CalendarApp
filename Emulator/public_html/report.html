        <h3>Introduction:</h3>
        <p>The first thing to say is that our expectations of what the prototype was going to be were very optimistic.
            The reminder application has turned out not how we intended, but lives up to its name; it is a calendar
            application. Our estimates of how long each part would take were all well under what actually happened.
            We never got actual alerts going, so as it stands the prototype can store reminders for each day with a time
            and print that to the screen when the day is clicked on. It functions like a physical calendar where
            you can write a note for a given day but it is up to you to check each day. Also like a paper calendar
            you cannot remove a reminder once it is added–ignoring the existence of pencils–except by reloading the page and thus 
            resetting the whole thing. There is functionality to delete a reminder but it did not get implemented in the user 
            interface before we ran out of time.
        </p>
        <h3>User Interface:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>When the page is loaded you will see a 320x320 canvas displaying a nice wee frog picture with a black square that has
                    "Calendar App" written over it, as well as the time below. At this point the only thing you can do is click the button
                    and this will start the application.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Now you can see a month view of a calendar for the current month. Each day of the month
                    is clickable via a double click which will take you to a new page which contains the reminders for that day (if there are any there already; if
                    there are not, it will take you straight to a page to enter a new reminder) and the place
                    to enter new reminders. A single click (or just a mouse down action to be more specific) on a day will enlarge the square so you can 
                    see it better which you will notice happens when you double click just before the canvas reloads. When the squares are enlarged they
                    will automatically reset after 2 seconds from when the first one was clicked.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In the calendar month view you can change the month by either: single clicking the '<' and '>' buttons for going back and forwards
                    respectively, or 'swiping' by holding down the left mouse button and then moving left(back) or right(forward), then releasing.
                    Be careful with swiping, as a slight movement in a click may be registered as a swipe, which can cause you to enter a day different
                    to the one you intended (we did try to fix this but only caused many more problems, that were significantly worse and/or harder to deal with).
                    To the best of our knowledge the days for each month in any given year will be correct (we have unit tests that test our inner calculation methods
                    for the months picked at random).
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Once inside a certain day, on the first entry to that day there will be a text box and a button saying "Enter". Using
                    the keyboard you can enter text into the box after clicking on it. This text will be your reminder, once you press enter
                    it will be stored and printed out to the screen under the date. You can add up to 9 reminders on one day (limited by screen space).
                    Each reminder will automatically be associated with a time of 08:00 in 24 hour format if you do not specify one. You can specify the
                    time by adding it to the end of the reminder in the text box. It MUST be in this '00:00' or this '0:00' format and be at the end of the entered text.
                    Technically you do not have to use 24 hour time but using am and pm will not work. When reminders are printed to the screen they will have an
                    " - at: (time)" after the reminder.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>When you press the "back" button down in the left hand corner of the day view it will return to the month. Now there will be a red square in
                    the bottom right corner of the day indicating that there is a reminder stored for that day (if you entered one). When you go back
                    to the day with a reminder in it all the stored reminders will be printed to the screen. There will now also be a "New" button in the
                    bottom right corner, you click this if you wish to add another reminder to that day and it will take you to the original add reminder
                    screen as before.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In the month view you can do a downwards swipe. This will bring up a view of all the 
                    reminders saved for that month and the days they are on. If the reminders are more than can fit on the screen there will be a next 
                    button which will take you to a new screen with rest of the reminders, this will happen over and over until all reminders have been displayed. 
                    There is still a very well known bug with this where the screen cutoff does not evaluate during printing events for a day, which means that if there
                    are 4 days each with one event, and the 5th day has two events, both events on the 5th day will print, and write over the button.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><p>Lastly the "Home" button in the monthly calendar view returns to the original emulator screen upon a double click. When this is done all the reminders 
                    are lost. We did not get round to fixing this bug and just wanted it to be known that we are aware of this problem.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Structure:</h3>
        <p>The reminder additions required a separate Javascript file (to act as a module) which is accessed by the prototype file only.
            The emulator are separate for coupling and decoupling reasons - the emulator has one call to the prototype (to initialise it), and the
            prototype calls the emulator whenever it needs something done to the canvas/HTML.</p>

        <h3>Tools:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>HTML validation was done through the W3 HTML direct text validator found <a href="https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input">here</a></li>
            <li>CSS Validation was done through the W3 CSS Validator (via direct text) found <a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/">here</a></li>
            <li>Javascript validation done through the <a href="http://www.jslint.com/">JSLint online option</a> - with the following options ticked 'Assume: a Browser',
                'Tolerate: for-statement, this, messy whitespace' and 'Global Variables: $' (The emulator had an extra global variable of 'prototype').</li>
            <li>Netbeans was used for coding and creating and managing the files.</li>
            <li>Github for our version control.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Tool Evaluation - JSLint</h4>
        <p>For Javascript validation, we tried creating a closure for the emulator, but that prevented it from being called in the prototype at all, because
            it was unable to find the emulator variable in the prototype despite being called through jQuery. We gave up, and better allocated our time towards finishing the
            other functions and the report. So there are a fair few warnings. This could have used an option to easily examine multiple files that are linked at once.</p>

        <h4>Tool Evaluation - Netbeans</h4>
        <p>Netbeans was a useful platform to use, particularly because it had support built in for github which allowed for easy and intuitive committing changes
            and for resolving conflicts. The biggest problem with netbeans (which you will find reflected in some particularly aggressive commits) is that it committed
            and conflicted the "private.xml" file that contained the directories of the files used in the project, so it wasn't particularly amenable to multiple users
            on the same branch (which included users merging branches) or multiple machines being used. It could be resolved, but it was a huge hassle.</p>

        <h4>Tool Evaluation - Github</h4>
        <p>Took us a fair while to figure out what to do, but once we got there it was alright. Resolving conflicts via command line felt a little clunky, and the whole thing
            was often just unusually obtuse with it's error messages and how it merged.
            In the end, it certainly did what we wanted it to do, perhaps we'll use a different kind of version control next time.</p>

        <h3>Testing:</h3>
        <h4>Difficulties</h4>
        <p>As most of our code didn't involve returning a value (and instead involved manipulation of global variables) unit testing was incredibly difficult to do.
            We have some, that can only test for correct month and date values, and correct swiping directions. One of the tests has since been removed, as the function
            it tested became obsolete. We looked at more advanced methods of testing using QUnit involving simulating keyboard/mouse input, but couldn't get them to 
            work.</p>
        
        <h4>Browser Compatability</h4>
        <p> Firefox, Safari and Google Chrome all work with the files we run in the project, and all tests pass in all those three browsers. This might have something
            to do with the lack of tests that we have.
            Due to the difficulties in creating unit tests the good majority of our testing was done manually using console.log or similar functions to return values or 
            print values and statements - some of these are left commented out in the code, though a large portion were deleted after that particular function or module was
            fully working. Safari and Chrome gave us small extra problems (time printed different things), but otherwise they were fine.</p>
        
        <h3>Our Coding Process:</h3>
        <p>The way we did the coding was admittedly not in any way the best. Firstly we should have gained a much greater understanding of Javascript
        before doing any coding. This might have prevented us from using Javascript altogether (such as using typescript) or at least made our code much more 
        organised and modular than it turned out. If we had this understanding we could have planned each part properly before proceeding by separating everything
        into classes or modules. In truth, we probably still could have done that, at least a little. But what we actually did was jump right into the code intending to learn as we went,
        which in hindsight almost never works. The other issue was the general understanding of what an emulator is. We know they are intended to mimic other devices
        such as gaming consoles, or smart watches on general computers but we didn't really know how to make one despite trying find out. Our emulator is something
        that does what is required of it to be a calendar but nothing more, which is what was asked.</p>
