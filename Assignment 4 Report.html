            <h1>Assignment 4 Report SWAD - Smart Watches Are Dumb</h1>
            <h4>Issue 1: What their thing is missing that we needed, but they didn't.</h4>
            <p>
              The E3 emulator is missing support for drawing basic shapes, like the squares
              we used for the calendar days, or writing text to the canvas, but it does
              have a canvas at least.
              There is no functionality for almost anything
              that our prototype needs to do. Except for setting a background image and key
              listeners.
              We could make use of these functions with a bit of fiddling, but certainly not
              directly. Essentially to get our prototype to work on this emulator we would
              be re-writing 90% of our own emulator into this one, unless we could make use
              of the phasor game engine somehow. That however is not code they wrote and probably
              shouldn't be used for a calendar.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is no general smart watch functionality in the emulator, it simply contains
              a few functions and objects that work to get a canvas and a game engine up and
              running. This is expected since we were told to only write as much as we need.
              But in doing this, porting a completely different application onto this new emulator
              is simply not going to happen without completely changing it. Our Calendar
              appplication needs to be able to get the time and date, draw text and shapes to the
              canvas, and also uses multiple mouse functions which are not supported in the emulator.
