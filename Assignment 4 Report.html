            <h1>Assignment 4 Report: SWAD (Smart Watches Are Dumb)</h1>
            <h4>1: What their thing is missing that we needed, but they didn't.</h4>
            <p>
              The E3 emulator is missing support for drawing basic shapes, like the squares
              we used for the calendar days, or writing text to the canvas, but it does
              have a canvas at least.
              There is no functionality for almost anything
              that our prototype needs to do. Except for setting a background image and key
              listeners.
              We could make use of these functions with a bit of fiddling, but certainly not
              directly. Essentially to get our prototype to work on this emulator we would
              be re-writing 90% of our own emulator into this one, unless we could make use
              of the phasor game engine somehow. That however is not code they wrote and probably
              shouldn't be used for a calendar.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is no general smart watch functionality in the emulator, it simply contains
              a few functions and objects that work to get a canvas and a game engine up and
              running. This is expected since we were told to only write as much as we need.
              But in doing this, porting a completely different application onto this new emulator
              is simply not going to happen without completely changing it. Our Calendar
              appplication needs to be able to get the time and date, draw text and shapes to the
              canvas, and also uses multiple mouse functions which are not supported in the emulator.
            </p>
            <p>
                Clearly our emulator would cause similar problems to whoever has it. It only supports what
                what we needed for our calendar and is very much specialized for that. This is all good and well but
                makes porting as far as we can see, not worthwhile.

          <h4>2: Interface</h4>
          <p>
            They have made a strong assumption that the person trying to run their program is going
            to have the time/knowledge to install multiple components on their computer before being
            able to run the application, or have Safari. We tried to follow the instructions to get the game to
            actually work but were unsuccessful. Either the instructions are not detailed enough,
            or we are not wise enough in this area--most likely both.
            Perhaps we could get it going but it might take
            hours to actually figure out. Time we do not have. However, it is supposed to work without any setup
            on Safari and it does not. The Safari console says it cannot find certain file. We don't have
            time to go trying to find out if the file should exist (it's not anywhere in the emulator files) or if the
            call to the file has got the name wrong somehow.
            Therefore it is hard to check the user
            interface further but we can make an assumption that it is simply playing the game,
            which is probably fine, and the instructions are reasonably clear about how to play
            the game.
          </p>
          <p>
            They have assumed that the people trying to run the application will be able to
            download and install multiple other programs onto their computer before using the
            emulator. They may not be connected to the internet, they may not have permissions
            to install this software if they are not on their home computer and they may not have Safari. Their interface is
            entirely built around utilising the game library and so has very little functionality
            beyond keybound keys. The assumptions that were made were a strong faith in the game
            library which effectively means there's nothing in the emulators interface (porting wise) capable of
            taking more than keypresses. This assumption obviously works against any thought of
            porting our prototype which processes drawing through the emulator and takes swipe
            functions instead of keypresses, and also listens for mouseclicks which also don't
            exist in this interface. Its assumption is very limited input through the interface
            - namely just the keypresses.
          </p>

          <h4>3: Buggy!</h4>
          <p>
            Well, the obvious answer there is that it appears buggy because we could not get it
            working in any of the multiple suggested ways. Otherwise, there's no other 
            appearance of bugs between browsers. Given we
            couldn't get the server working, and thus couldn't run the game, we couldn't get it
            started and aren't in any position to critique how the game actually runs. We can just
            say that it doesn't.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>4: Documentation.</h4>
          <p>
            Aside from the problems installing the required server, the documentation is extensive,
            it's well formatted, well presented, and overall quite well done. Compared with our
            documentation, it certainly shows that we could have done a lot lot better. A lot
            clearer and in a better structured HTML form. The Users/Developers split is excellent,
            despite not being particularly helpful in installing the server.
          </p>
          <p>
            That's where it falls down. The instructions appear to assume some knowledge of what
            is going on that we apparently don't have. They're unclear as to what's going on, what
            we're expected to actually see as a result of failure or success, and where anything is
            supposed to be. We followed multiple supplied ways of installing said server to run, and
            were stumped each time.
          </p>
          <p>
            The documentation also is only geared towards developers using the game specific
            functions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Listing known bugs could've been more detailed.
