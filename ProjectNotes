#Notes of how the Project is Shaping Up

24/04 - George:
      So far, Netbeans has been a little annoying in how it can commit something without comitting the entire project at once.
      I've figured out how that works, and reworked some of the stuff Ben had done on the emulator, because it wasn't being saved
      as an openable netbeans project file because of this. We have the emulator displaying current date/time as a javascript
      script - but I haven't had a close look at it so I'm not sure if it needs some kind of infinite loop or it's own species
      of "pull" requests to refresh that, or if it statically updates as the time does.
